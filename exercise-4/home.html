          Buidling Your Own Personal Computer (BYOPC) is a very popular hobby among tech 
          and gaming enthusiasts.  It can go anywhere from building low cost and affordable gaming rigs to
          high end computing machines that can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Building your own computing rig is a satisfying activity that can stretch your experience in 
          both hardware and software design.  There are important things to keep in my mind before we get started:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure that you have a budget in mind before embarking on building your first gaming or computing
            rig.  Not knowing exactly how much money you want to spend before hand may end up costing you more money
            at the end of the build.  It's okay if it's only an estimate.  Certainly, you'll be off by a few dollars
            but if you find yourself spending anywhere between $100 and $200 more than what you anticipated, then something has 
            gone awry during the build process.  Your original rough order costs should only be between 5 to 10 percent of
            your original estimate.  Don't beat yourself too much if you're off by a few dollars. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you know what you plan on gettiing out of your gaming or computing rig.  If you plan to build
            a high-end gaming rig, then expect to spend a few extra dollars.  The key is knowing what you want to get
            out of the machine so you're not taken aback with the costs at the end of the build.
          </li>
          <li>
            Last but not least, pay close attention to proper grounding techniques.  Over the years, we've noticed
            a lot of builders not paying careful attention to Electrostatic Discharge (ESD).  ESD has been known to damage 
            electrical components.  A lot of times, the worst cases are the damage we don't even notice.  These type of damages
            occur gradually and often times degrade your gaming rig over time.  Electronic components can be damaged by ESD with voltages 
            as low as 20 volts (or even lower).  Make sure you discharge static electricity prior to handling any electronic equipment.  
            Better yet, make sure you are using proper anti-ESD practices like using anti-static mats and ESD wrist straps.

          A motherboard (also called the mainboard) is a printed circuit board (PCB) in a general purpose computer system.
          It is made up of layers of conductive and non-conductive layers that allow communications among the different components of 
          a computing system.  It is comprised of various slots for both the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Random Access Memory (RAM).  
          It has connectors for various storage devices like solid state and disk drives as well as universal serial bus controllers.  It has
          important sub-systems like the front side bus, memory controllers, and other integrated devices that allow high
          speed data communications among the computer systems major components.

        <p>
          The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is considered the brain of a general purpose computer system.  It is a semiconductor device that
          performs basic arithmetic and logic operations through machine language that is comprised of millions of instructions per second.
          Due to rapid advancements in technology, modern CPUs are implemented using integrated circuit microprocessors normally numbering 
          in the millions.  Moreover, many modern CPUs can include multiple cores and are able to execute multi-threaded operations.

      <p>
          Random Access Memory is a type of volatile memory that allow computer systems to readily store and access data on a short term
          basis.  It is one of the most important components of the computer system that determines its performance.  RAM allows the CPU
          to store and retrieve data at very high speeds in order for the CPU to perform its required instructions and operations.  Modern day
          RAMs takes the form of Integrated Ciruits with multiplexing and demultiplexing capabilities.

          There are two types of memories:

          <ul>
              <li>Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)</li>
              <li>Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)</li>

          The Power Supply Unit (PSU) is what provides electrical power to the integrated computer system.  It takes 120 VAC input power and 
          converts and conditions 120 VAC voltage into low voltage DC supply for the computer system's major components like the CPU, storage devices, 
          GPU, and other peripheral devices.

          Is the secondary storage device used by computer systems to store data.  Unlike Random Access Memory, it is a type of non-volatile memory that allows
          long-term storage of data.  Furthermore, these type of storage devices can retain data with or without power.  Older drives come in the form of Hard Disk Drives, which 
          is a type of optical mechanical device that use magnetic storage.  More contemporary storage come in the form of Solid State Devices (SSD) which is a 
          type of NAND flash drive.
